        <h2 id="issue">issue</h2>
        <p>usually, i don’t use graphical user interface when working w/
        git repos, and all of my work is happening in terminal. the same
        w/ github web page, i rarely visit it. one day, i decided to do
        so, to see how things are going there, and discovered that on my
        github landing page there was no any single commit that i had
        been doing through time. actually, when going into the repos,
        all of the commits were listed, but…</p>
        <h2 id="background">background</h2>
        <h3 id="git">git</h3>
        <p>googling this issue, i’ve found that <em>git</em> tracks
        commits based on their <em>author</em> and <em>committer</em>
        emails.</p>
        <p>the question is who is the author and who is the
        committer?</p>
        <p>an <em>author</em> is one who creates a patch file. patch
        file is, as i get it, basically, a list of files and changes
        that will be included in next commit.</p>
        <p>a <em>committer</em> is one who makes a patch file one step
        further into a commit.</p>
        <p>the same w/ books. a writer is an author of a book. but a
        book can have completely different publisher.</p>
        <p><em>then i remembered, that i’ve changed my github email
        address last month, and not having this change reproduced in my
        local config file</em></p>
        <h3 id="github">github</h3>
        <p>github hosting service treats commit as
        <strong>yours</strong> if its [commit’s] <em>author email</em>
        is same w/ your <em>github account email</em>. no matter who the
        committer was, if it has <em>author email</em> matched w/ you
        <em>github account email</em> then you’re <em>the author</em>
        and the commit will be displayed on your github landing
        page.</p>
        <p>thus, when i’ve changed my github email address, i lost
        ownership of all of my past commits at once.</p>
        <h2 id="workflow">workflow</h2>
        <h3 id="check-git-configurations">check <code>git</code>
        configurations</h3>
        <p>first of all, once you are in your git repo, it is good to
        check user name and email w/ the following cmds:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>git config --&lt;global | local&gt; --list | grep user</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>i <em>strongly</em> recommend you to set git user name and
        email on you machine before you start any work w/ the repo,
        cause this will get you rid of many troubles hereafter. do this
        w/ the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>git config --&lt;global | local&gt; user.name "&lt;your-name&gt;"</code></li>
        <li><code>git config --&lt;global | local&gt; user.name "&lt;your-email&gt;"</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>starting from here, your future commits will have both
        <em>author email</em> and <em>commit email</em> the same.</p>
        <h3 id="check-commits-author-and-committer">check commit’s
        author and committer</h3>
        <p>already having commits in your repo, you can check who is the
        author and the committer w/:</p>
        <p><code>git cat-file -p &lt;commit&gt;</code></p>
        <p>again, for github to treat the commit as yours, <em>author
        email</em> has to match w/ <em>github account email</em>.</p>
        <h3 id="changing-author-email">changing <em>author
        email</em></h3>
        <p>in my case, i wanted to change commits’ author name. some
        googling, and i’ve done this w/ the following:</p>
        <pre><code>git rebase -r --root --exec \
&#39;git commit --amend --no-edit --author=&quot;your-name &lt;your-email&gt;&quot;</code></pre>
        <p>this introduces completely new commits w/ new sha-hashes. in
        fact, only your <em>account email</em> will be changed. in order
        for <em>commit email</em> to be changed, you have to make sure
        that you’ve configured <code>--&lt;global | local&gt;</code>
        name and email address before executing this command.</p>
