        <blockquote>
        <p>you’re not w/out talent, you’re w/out direction</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>i think, this is the first thing you have to consider when starting something new. this doesn’t matter your color, your ethnic background, your social status or your education. this will definitely help you to set the direction of your journey through life.</p>
        <p>below are some questions, i think, everyone should ask themselves:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>why do i start doing what i start to do?</li>
        <li>who will benefit from what i start to do?</li>
        <li>what will the future look like?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>for sure, each of us will have different answers on these questions, based on our values. but, here is the thing. each individual will have noticed his/her answers change while growing as a person. so ask yourself these questions frequently, for it will help you to adjust the direction.</p>
