        <blockquote>
        <p>it is all about being an individual</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>one day, i started to repeat my english grammar. going through exercises, i found that i need to complete some exercises by taking a physical pen and writing them down. after i took a pen and began to write, i noticed that my handwriting worsened to a great extent. during my time in university, i thought, i had a good penmanship, (it was not great, though). so i realized that my handwriting became worse than it was before.</p>
        <p>now, i think, is a good time to count the reasons that had led me to what i have. first of all, this is all due to my day-to-day usage of pc for every task requiring any form of writing, even for taking notes. second, i write on paper when doing math. while doing this, i usually don’t take care of the shape of letters, thus it actually looks like donald trump handwriting. just google <code>trump handwriting</code> and you’ll get what i mean. and that’s it. these are the only times i’ve used my hand and a pen to put something on a paper. all other cases of writing are just using a physical or onscreen keyboard.</p>
        <p>given these reasons, i got astonished when i tried penmanship. after that, the journey to improve my handwriting has begun. i will describe what resources i use later. but for now i just wanted to raise this topic cause i think being able to handwrite good is what makes you a better individual.</p>
        <p>in my opinion you should definitely spend time learning how to handwrite properly. you have to spend time learning how to hold a pen properly, how to sit straight, how to make the shape of letters consistent - not one “a” being three times larger than another.</p>
