        <p>following is the excrept from ryan groove’s, <a
        href="https://twitter.com/yaypie"
        class="uri">https://twitter.com/yaypie</a>, creator of rawgit,
        final letter</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>RawGit is now in a sunset phase and will soon shut down. It’s
        been a fun five years, but all things must end.</p>
        <p>GitHub repositories that served content through RawGit within
        the last month will continue to be served until at least October
        of 2019. URLs for other repositories are no longer being
        served.</p>
        <p>If you’re currently using RawGit, please stop using it as
        soon as you can.</p>
        <p>Why this is happening</p>
        <p>RawGit has always been a small hobby project. I’ve never been
        able to spend more than a handful of minutes a week on it, but
        it achieved a degree of popularity I could never have
        imagined.</p>
        <p>Last month alone RawGit served over 4.2 billion requests and
        consumed more than 176 terabytes of bandwidth. Those numbers are
        simply unfathomable to me. They’re almost too huge to be
        real.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, RawGit has also become an attractive
        distribution mechanism for malware. RawGit was meant to improve
        people’s lives, but jerks are increasingly using it to hurt
        people.</p>
        <p>Since I have almost no time to devote to fighting malware and
        abuse on RawGit (and since it would be no fun even if I did have
        the time), I feel the responsible thing to do is to shut it
        down. I would rather kill RawGit than watch it be used to hurt
        people</p>
