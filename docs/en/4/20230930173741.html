        <blockquote>
        <p>data analysis is just a tool that assists you in what you actually like</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>during my job search, w/ my little knowledge of excel, sql and python, i was looking for any position as a junior data analyst or anything alike.</p>
        <p>one day, i’d tried it into an electrical construction company (they needed someone who just knows excel good), they’d agreed to give me a job position, but i’d refused back then due to the salary was very low, even though, the construction is what i like the most.</p>
        <p>so the time went by, i’d been doing many data analysis assessment tests from recruiters from many industries: e-commerce, medicine, logistics. failing some and passing others, i realized that, being a data analyist requires you to dig into the field which is being analyzed - you’ve to learn intrinsics of the field to be able to create good reports, thus being a better data analyst.</p>
        <p>given that, the question raised in my mind, <em>whether i want to spend the time learning an industry that i don’t like</em>. <strong>this is the question</strong> i think everyone should ask themselves before becoming a <em>universal</em> data analyst.</p>
        <p>being a <em>universal</em> data analyst is like being a hitman. for a hitman no matter what the target is, he just executes. the same is true for a <em>universal</em> data analyst, no matter what the industry is, whenever he’s been offered a job position, he just executes.</p>
        <p>information on the internet is growing fast everyday, so the information we need to analyze. in my opinion, data analysis is a tool that every person in the 21st century has to master. it is like being able to read a text at before-internet times. computer-assissted analysis of the data will help you to make proper decisions in our increasing-data-driven world.</p>
