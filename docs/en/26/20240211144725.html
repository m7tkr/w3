        <h1 id="mirrors-edge-the-conglomerate">mirror’s edge: the conglomerate</h1>
        <p>i found it interesting the openning speech of protagonist in mirror’s edge video game. below is the partial transcript:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>once, the city used to pulse with energy. dirty and dangerous, but alive and wonderful. now it’s something else. the changes came slowly at first. most did not realize or did not care, and accepted them. they chose a comfortable life. some didn’t. … and those who refused to conform were pushed to the sideline… criminalized. …</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>the general setting is elaborated in the second part of the video game:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>in the city of glass the conglomerate rules supreme. all regular citizens have been made willing slaves, lured into an endless race for status and wealth. but some choose to live off the grid. … as long as they don’t openly challange the authorities, the conglomerate turns a blind eye. …</p>
