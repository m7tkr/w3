# data analysis

> data analysis is just a tool that assists you in what you actually like

during my job search, w/ my little knowledge of excel, sql and python, i was
looking for any position as a junior data analyst or anything alike.

one day, i'd tried it into an electrical construction company (they needed someone who just
knows excel good), they'd agreed to give me a job position, but i'd refused back then
due to the salary was very low, even though, the construction is what i like
the most.

so the time went by, i'd been doing many data analysis assessment tests from recruiters from many
industries: e-commerce, medicine, logistics. failing some and passing others, i
realized that, being a data analyist requires you to dig into the field which
is being analyzed - you've to learn intrinsics of the field to be able to create
good reports, thus being a better data analyst.

given that, the question raised in my mind, *whether i want to spend the time
learning an industry that i don't like*. **this is the question** i think
everyone should ask themselves before becoming a *universal* data analyst.

being a *universal* data analyst is like being a hitman. for a
hitman no matter what the target is, he just executes. the same is true for a
*universal* data analyst, no matter what the industry is, whenever he's been
offered a job position, he just executes.

information on the internet is growing fast everyday, so the information
we need to analyze. in my opinion, data analysis is a tool that every person
in the 21st century has to master. it is like being able to read a text at
before-internet times. computer-assissted analysis of the data will help you
to make proper decisions in our increasing-data-driven world.
