# touch typing

> it is all about xxi

i think being able to type w/out looking at a keyboard and looking for a letter
you want to type is very important in the age of computers. that's why i want
to suggest you a website that will help you on your way to blind typing.

no matter what the language is, you choose whatever you work, and start
training. hope this helps.
