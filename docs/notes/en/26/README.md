# the conglomerate

i found it interesting the openning speech of protagonist in mirror's edge
video game. below is the part transcript:

> once, the city used to pulse with energy. dirty and dangerous, but alive
> and wonderful. now it's something else. the changes came slowly at first.
> most did not realize or did not care, and accepted them. they chose a
> comfortable life. some didn't. ... and those who refused to conform were
> pushed to the sideline... criminalized. they became our clients. ...

the general setting elaborates in the second part of the video game:

> in the city of glass the conglomerate rules supreme. all regular citizens
> have been made willing slaves, lured into an endless race for status and
> wealth. but some choose to live off the grid. runners work as couriers and
> cat burglars. the rooftops belong to them. as long as they don't openly
> challange the authorities, the conglomerate turns a blind eye. for almost
> two decades the status quo has held. times are about to change.
