# penmanship

> it is all about being an individual

one day, i started to repeat my english grammar. going through exercises, i
found that i need to complete some exercises by taking a physical pen and writing them down. after
i took a pen and began to write, i noticed that my handwriting worsened to a
great extent. during my time in university, i thought, i had a good penmanship,
(it was not great, though). so i realized that my handwriting became worse than
it was before.

now, i think, is a good time to count the reasons that had led me to what i
have. first of all, this is all due to my day-to-day usage of pc for
every task requiring any form of writing, even for taking notes. second, i
write on paper when doing math.
while doing this, i usually don't take care of the shape of letters, thus it
actually looks like donald trump handwriting. just google `trump handwriting`
and you'll get what i mean. and that's it. these are the only times i've used
my hand and a pen to put something on a paper. all other cases of writing are
just using a physical or onscreen keyboard.

given these reasons, i got astonished when i tried penmanship. after that, the
journey to improve my handwriting has begun. i will describe what resources i
use later. but for now i just wanted to raise this topic cause i think
being able to handwrite good is what makes you a better individual.

in my opinion you should definitely spend time learning how to handwrite
properly. you have to spend time learning how to hold a pen properly, how to
sit straight, how to make the shape of letters consistent - not one "a" being
three times larger than another.
