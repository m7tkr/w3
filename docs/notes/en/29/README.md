# blockchain: coins vs tokens

all coins *may be* considered tokens, but no all tokens are considered
coins.

make the difference

coins have their own blockchain, while tokens are build on existing 
blockchains

## coins

* **ethereum**'s native asset is ether (eth)
* **algorand**'s native asset is algorand (algo)
* **cardano**'s native asset is ada

so, from above ethereum, algorand and cardano are all blockchais, while eth, algo and ada are their coins.

## tokens

* uniswap's native asset is uni
