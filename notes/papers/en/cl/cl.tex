    Dear Hiring Manager, \par
    \vspace{15pt}
    Please consider me for this position. I am making career transition from 
    being physician to becoming data analyst. \par
    \vspace{15pt}
    During my study at the university, I learned programming languages and used 
    them to automate tasks on my computer. At the same time, I repeated 
    the math required for Data Science, which is my area of interest. 
    During my work, I used MS Office Excel extensively, thus I gained
    experience in compiling daily reports. \par
    \vspace{15pt}
    I've attached my resume to this document.
    Thank you for your time in considering my application. 
    Please contact me by phone or email to schedule an interview or 
    if you have any questions regarding my candidacy. \par

    Sincerely, \par
