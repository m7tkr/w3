Dear Hiring Manager,
Please consider me for this position. I am making career transition from being physician to becoming data analyst.
During my study at the university, I learned programming languages and used them to automate tasks on my computer. At the same time, I repeated the math required for Data Science, which is my area of interest. During my work, I used MS Oﬀice Excel extensively, thus I gained experience in compiling daily reports.
I’ve attached my resume to this document. Thank you for your time in considering my application. Please contact me by phone or email to schedule an interview or if you have any questions regarding my candidacy.

Sincerely, Rustam Jafar
